                <h3>Bourbon Street</h3>
                <p>A culmination of layered histories of architectural and cultural influences, Bourbon Street travels athe 13 blocks between Esplanade Ave on the eastern end and Canal street on the western end. One of the original streets laid out in 1721 under the direction of the French royal engineer, Adrien de Pauger, it was originally dubbed Rue Bourbon, in keeping with the use of Catholic saints and French royal houses as naming sources. New Orleans remained a French territory until 1763, when it was transferred to the Spanish in the aftermath of the Seven Year's War. Approximately 80% of the city's buildings were subqequently destroyed in 1788 as a result of a massive fire that devastated the city. Consequently, Bourbon Street(Calle De Borbon at the time), as well as the surrounding French Quarter, ironically bear more signs of Spanish influence than French. Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Bourbon Street took on the name we recognize today. Although a premier residential neighborhood until 1900, Bourbon Street underwent the early stages of its transformation into the party destination it is known as today as a result of the late 1800's construction of the Storyville Red Light District on nearby Basin Street. The ensuing associations with alcohol-fueled, risqu&eacute; pursuits have remained a persistent element of the historic thoroughfare's reputation through the current day.

                <h3>Caf&eacute; Du Monde</h3>
                <p>Anchoring the upriver end of the French Market, Caf&eacute; Du Monde is a beloved institution of tourists and locals alike. The business has been in near-continuous operation at the same location since it's establishment in 1862; due to Hurricane Katrina, the caf&eacute; closed it's doors at midnight, August 27, 2015 until reopening on October 19, 2015. Promoted as a sign of the beginning stages of the city's recovery, the occasion received nationwide coverage by over 100 news media outlets. To this day, the menu remains limited and straightforward, consisting of only 6 items:dark-roast coffee with chicory(available black or au lait), beignets, chocolate or plain milk, hot chocolate, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. The beignets are an absolute delight; they are square donuts with no hole, fried so that they puff up and then liberally dusted with powdered sugar. A treat not to be missed, but make sure you don't eat them over your clothes! We took advantage of the shop's proximity to the Mississipi River to enjoy a delicious breakfast with a fantastic view, and topped it off with a bloody mary each for good measure.</p>
