                    <h3>Bourbon Street</h3>
                    <p>A culmination of layered histories of architectural and cultural influences, Bourbon Street travels the 13 blocks between Esplanade Ave on the eastern end and Canal street on the western end. One of the original streets laid out in 1721 under the direction of the French royal engineer, Adrien de Pauger, it was originally dubbed Rue Bourbon, in keeping with the use of Catholic saints and French royal houses as naming sources. New Orleans remained a French territory until 1763, when it was transferred to the Spanish in the aftermath of the Seven Year's War. Approximately 80% of the city's buildings were subqequently destroyed in 1788 as a result of a massive fire that devastated the city. Consequently, Bourbon Street(Calle De Borbon at the time), as well as the surrounding French Quarter, ironically bear more signs of Spanish influence than French. Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Bourbon Street took on the name we recognize today. Although a premier residential neighborhood until 1900, Bourbon Street underwent the early stages of its transformation into the party destination it is known as today as a result of the late 1800's construction of the Storyville Red Light District on nearby Basin Street. The ensuing associations with alcohol-fueled, risqu&eacute; pursuits have remained a persistent element of the historic thoroughfare's reputation through the current day.</p>

                    <h3>Caf&eacute; Du Monde</h3>
                    <p>Anchoring the upriver end of the French Market, Caf&eacute; Du Monde is a beloved institution of tourists and locals alike. The business has been in near-continuous operation at the same location since it's establishment in 1862; due to Hurricane Katrina, the caf&eacute; closed it's doors at midnight, August 27, 2015 until reopening on October 19, 2015. Promoted as a sign of the beginning stages of the city's recovery, the occasion received nationwide coverage by over 100 news media outlets. To this day, the menu remains limited and straightforward, consisting of only 6 items:dark-roast coffee with chicory(available black or au lait), beignets, chocolate or plain milk, hot chocolate, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. The beignets are an absolute delight; they are square donuts with no hole, fried so that they puff up and then liberally dusted with powdered sugar. A treat not to be missed, but make sure you don't eat them over your clothes! We took advantage of the shop's proximity to the Mississipi River to enjoy a delicious breakfast with a fantastic view, and topped it off with a bloody mary each for good measure.</p>

                    <h3>The French Market</h3>
                    <p>After scarfing down our beignets and caf&eacute; au lait and securing the aforementioned bloody marys, we proceeded downriver to the remainder of the French Market. There, the scents of sumptuous seafood mingled with the sounds of jazz and sights of vendors hawking their various wares delighted the senses. Now spanning 6 blocks of Decatur Street in the French Quarter, this long-lived establishment is the oldest of its kind in the United States; as one would expect, the facilities have been subject to numerous renovations and rebuilds since the location was designated as a market in 1791. As such, the oldest structures on the site are dated ca. 1813.</p>

                    <h3>The Garden District</h3>
                    <p>The Garden District's boundaries, as defined by the City Planning Commission, are St. Charles Avenue, 1st Street, Magazine Street, and Toledano Street(on the north, east, south, and west sides, respectively). It's original development during the period between 1832 and 1900 was a result of the subdivision and sale of former plantations. The plots were transferred primarily to wealthy Americans, drawn to the the city's prosperity yet not desiring to live alongside the Creole population of the French Quarter. Such cultural divides remain evident in the city today, and are especially demarcated by the division of Canal Street. At its inception, blocks consisted of only a couple of mansions, surrounded by the gardens that would provide the district with its namesake. Just prior to the 20th century, these lots were subdivided; houses in the late Victorian Period style were constructed. The majority of these original mansions and adjacent houses remain today, garnering the district a status as one of the most well-preserved collections of historic mansions in the Southern United States. For fans of architecture, this is a destination not to be missed. We decided to improve our stroll through the area by accompanying it with gelato from the nearby sweets-dealer, Sucre. </p>

                    <h3>Mother's Restaurant</h3>
                    <p>Mother's is a New Orlean's institution, founded in 1938 and operating in the same location since. It was originally owned by Simon and Mary (Mother) Landry, and became famous for the po' boys that their family served there. In 1986, the business was sold to John and Jerry Amato; they expanded the menu to offer traditional New Orleans dishes such as crawfish etouf&eacute;e and jambalaya, while retaining crowd-pleasers like the Ferdi Special and debris po' boy. For an eating experience that's hard to top, you can't go wrong with Mother's. Be prepared to wait, as lines are often out the door but always worth it. </p>

                    <h3>K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen</h3>
                    <p>In 1979, renowned chef Paul Prudhomme and his wife, Kay, opened K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in the French Quarter. The success of this establishment, as well as Prudhomme's distinguished career, is touted as a major source of the explosion in popularity of cajun cuisine. Chef Prudhomme's demonstration of his skills garnered him worldwide recognition; to honor the work he did with Creole and Cajun cuisine, the French Ordre National du M&eacute;rite Agricole bestowed upon him the title of Chevalier(Knight) in 1980. With exemplary cocktails, top-of-the-line cuisine, and impeccable atmosphere, K-Paul's is one of the best dining establishments I've ever visited.</p>
